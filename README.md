  In Francis Hodgson Burnett’s The Secret Garden, nature is a transformative space capable of healing both mental and physical illness. The Secret Garden's healing narrative reminded me of my years living in Asheville, North Carolina, a place heavily advertised as one where “the pale health-seeker findeth there the wine of life in the pleasant air” (Chapin 76).
Known for its “forests of hardwood and spruce and balsam; rivers and sparkling mountain streams; cascades and falls, and a climate unsurpassed in all the world for any season,” Asheville has been often known as “America’s Beauty Spot” (Asheville). Because of these resources, Asheville is a town associated with healing and natural medicine. However, not everyone can gain access to this miracle space. This last year, it became impossible for a family to buy a house for less than 275k (The Asheville). The scenic and beautiful resorts and nature spots, such as Hot Springs, cost a lot of money to enjoy. The servants depicted in The Secret Garden partake in nature like their wealthy employers. However, their interactions with nature are laborious, not leisurely. Nonetheless, Burnett describes them as happy-go-lucky with their lot in life, but what’s the reality? While Asheville has an affluent population for such a small southern town, many residents are homeless or in poverty, living beside wealthy retirees and business owners. After my experiences living in Asheville and conducting much research, it has become evident that these Edenic healing spaces are not for everyone. Over time, natural areas have been co-opted and used for capital, no longer making them accessible and thus no longer making them universally “natural” at all. Barriers, such as race and class, act as fences, allowing the few chosen inside and keeping everyone else at bay, proving that natural living and relaxation is a privilege only some can afford.

  The British moors that Mary moves to in The Secret Garden are described as “a deep, cool blue, which almost seemed to sparkle like the waters of some lovely, bottomless lake, and here and there, high, high in the arched blueness, floated small clouds of snow-white fleece” (Burnett 68). Descriptions of the secret garden are especially magical. Often Mary is depicted “under one of the fairy-like arches” in the garden (Burnett 89). Similarly, old brochures of Asheville show it as magical and Edenic; “covered with a luxuriant growth of primitive forests of pine, balsam, and the handsomest of the deciduous variety of trees generally, the mountains being wooded to their very summits, an unusual and an attractive feature, which delights the eye and at once impresses most favorably the tourist and health seeker” (Chapin 85). In a 19th-century book on Climatotherapy, it is stated that “there is no mountain region in the eastern United States which equals in beauty and grandeur this sublime section of North Carolina” (Chaille 10). In The Secret Garden, Burnett highlights Edwardian beliefs regarding the significance of the garden and nature by emphasizing the beauty of natural British surroundings (Hayes). Likewise, drawn-out descriptions of Asheville express awe and amazement. The atmosphere of these beautiful places is met with connotations of healing. The secret garden is responsible for healing Mary and Colin, and Asheville is widely known for its overall holistic value. Chapin describes “the prevailing winds from the mountains” as “always cool and refreshing, which, together with the health-giving atmosphere, the invigorating days and refreshing nights, all combine to make this region a natural sanitarium” (Chapin 77). Like in The Secret Garden, there is an emphasis on breathing in the fresh, natural air. Beliefs surrounding Asheville focus heavily on the “purity of the air, rarity, and dryness of the air” (Chapin 99). Colin and Mary are often described as inhaling the clean British air like medicine, which stems from the prevalent British mindset at the time that the countryside was “a place of physical and psychological healing” (Toth 141).

# Physical and Mental Healing

The narrative of holistic healing displayed in The Secret Garden and advertisements of Asheville depicts a mystical ability to heal physical illness. When Mary first arrives in England, she is described as “such a plain little piece of goods!” (Burnett 13). She is often depicted as sickly, thin, and “yeller.” At first, Mary also has a small appetite and refuses to eat her meals. However, on the night of the first day she stayed outside all day, “she felt hungry and drowsy and comfortable” when she sat down for supper (Burnett 53). Later, Mary is also described as “fatter,” less yellow, and “glowing with exercise and good spirits” (Burnett 189). Like Mary, Colin is initially described as weak and sickly, having “had coughs an’ colds that’s nearly killed him two or three times” (Burnett 159). However, after spending time in the garden, “magic was working all the afternoon and making Colin look an entirely different boy” (Burnett 249). As with Colin, Mary’s physical transformation directly results from the garden. Together, Mary and Colin “put their eager young noses close to the earth” and “sniffed its warmed springtime breathing” until they have both been healed by what Dickon warrants is “better than doctor’s stuff” (Burnett 180, 186). 

Like the secret garden, the land of Asheville is viewed and advertised as “the head of Southern health resorts,” where “celebrated physicians who have made climatology a study name Asheville as pre-eminent in possessing the cool, dry, bracing air necessary to health” (Chapin 77). Like Dickon’s description of the garden, Chapin also describes Asheville as “better than all the physician’s prescriptions” (Chapin 85). Many health resorts and hospitals have been built in the area because of the widespread belief in correlations between natural healing and Asheville. One such example from the 19th century is Dr. William Gleitsmann’s Mountain Sanitarium for Pulmonary Diseases, which was once described as “long noted for its agreeable climate and great salubrity” and a place where “consumption is almost unknown to its inhabitants” (Chaille 11). Situated alongside Asheville is Hot Springs, North Carolina, which is still known for its healing properties.  It was once understood that “dyspepsia and other diseases of the stomach yield quickly to the beneficial action of internal as well as external use of this water” (Chapin 132). After visiting Asheville and its surrounding areas, guests were expected to heal at least somewhat no matter their physical sickness. This ideology still holds for many today. Asheville is still “home to some of the most gifted holistic practitioners in the nation” (Top Wellness).

In The Secret Garden, the fresh English environment works to transform Mary and Colin, not just physically but mentally, as they go from “sour” and anxious to normal, happy, healthy children. As Emma Hayes states in “The Restorative Power of Nature,” the novel is, “in fact, a sensitive and complex story, which explores how a relationship with nature can foster our emotional and physical well-being” (Hayes). Much of the therapy in Burnett’s time, specifically for women, depended upon the rest cure, which Burnett herself underwent treatment. Because of this, “these largely unsuccessful cures may have contributed to Burnett’s lifelong distrust of mainstream medicine,” thus causing Burnett to focus much of Mary’s recovery around the outdoors and gardening (Stiles). Not only is Mary described as physically weak and ill when she arrives in England, but her mental health is also on the decline. She is called “sour little Mary” (Burnette 19). Over time, however, her attitude and temperament transform just like her physical health. The novel states that “there is no doubt that the fresh, strong, pure air from the moor had a great deal to do with it. Just as it had given her an appetite, and fighting with the wind had stirred her blood, so the same things had stirred her mind” (Burnett 77). She is also stated as “more civil than she had been” (Burnett 103). As with their physical health, a similar mental transformation also takes place in Colin. The Secret Garden describes Colin’s wild “tantrums as having grown “out of his hysterical hidden fear” (Burnett 197). When Mary goes into his room during one, his face is described as “ white and red, and swollen,” and he is “gasping and choking” (Burnett 201). Over time, however, Colin’s attitude improves, and he slowly begins to fret less about being sick and dying. He goes from often proclaiming how he will die to yelling that “I think I should live to grow up!” (Burnett 206). These mental transformations occur not only in the children’s temperaments but also in how they think and react to things. During one of Colin’s episodes, Mary contemplates how “when she had had a headache in India, she had done her best to see that everybody else also had a headache or something quite as bad. And she felt she was quite right; but, of course, now she felt that Colin was quite wrong” (Burnett 191). This thought represents more than just feelings of happiness but also conveys a fundamental change in Mary’s attitude.  By the end of the novel, Colin and Mary’s mental transformation is further depicted as they are both shown laughing together, contrasting the descriptions of when they are first introduced (Burnett 264). 

I cannot help but draw similarities between the mental healing that takes place in the minds of Mary and Colin to that of Zelda Fitzgerald and many others that moved to Asheville to attend Highland Hospital. Highland Hospital was a psychiatric facility founded in 1904 to treat the mentally ill. Many outdoor activities played a major role in the therapy provided (A Closer). It was believed that in Asheville, “the invigorating mountain air, coupled with the healing breath of the pine, gives new life to the invalid, rejuvenating the overtasked brain, nerves and body, and toning up the whole system,” thus Asheville was “a grand sanatorium for pulmonary and nervous sufferers” (Chapin 77, 85).  Zelda herself had mental illnesses, and in a letter to Gerad Murphy, F. Scott Fitzgerald writes that “I am moving Zelda to a sanitarium in Asheville” (Fitzgerald 217). During her time at Highland Hospital, Zelda wrote F. Scott, “I am coming to life- thanks ever so much for the canvas-There’s a magnificent patch of blue sky drifting through some pines here that I’m going to paint- These open fields seem more like summer and a rich dreamy warmth of youth than toy villages on the mountainside” (Fitzgerald 221). These descriptions mirror the dreamy awe-inducing depictions of nature in  The Secret Garden. While Zelda never completely healed at Highland, and some of the hospital’s practices proved to be much less than ideal, the hope and ideology of being psychologically cured by the natural atmosphere is the same one that is conveyed successfully in The Secret Garden.

# Healing for Who?
![Secret Garden](https://3ncridad6ai1jg5mt30vexk1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/elementor/thumbs/AdobeStock_177898293-scaled-p4lufii8e37a4lofsxybe1r5sf5el28x0vqyqsihuo.jpeg)
Regardless of whether or not it has always been successful, Asheville's beautiful, transformative nature is not to be enjoyed by everyone. At one point in time, Asheville’s healing spaces were shared and used by everyone. However, white Europeans soon co-opted the land from Indigenous individuals, and people now have to pay money to engage in the land’s holistic properties. Chapin tells how in 1812, “Asheville was an Indian trading-post, and by 1833, “the town was incorporated under the name of Morristown” (Chapin 83). The rejuvenating nature of the Hot Springs was first discovered “over one hundred years ago,” when “the Cherokee Indians were found using Hot Springs Water to cure rheumatic and kindred troubles so prevalent in the systems of these dusky warriors.” The environment and people living in it were then made subjects in an Empire of white Europeans where “the colonizers modified their new surroundings in the act of claiming and settling it” (Toth 119). From that moment on, “white men have found relief in these waters, which are a positive cure for rheumatism” (Chapin 132-133). This running theme of land being stolen or gatekept as white places often accompanies natural and holistic places. In The Secret Garden, Mary can only be healed when she enters a white European space away from where she once lived in India. Martha even blames Mary’s state on the people in India themselves, saying, “‘I dare say it’s because there’s such a lot o’ blacks there instead o’ respectable white people.’”(Burnett 29). It is important to note that Asheville itself is populated by mostly white individuals, so while some people benefit from living in “the land of the sky,” it is certainly not accessible to everyone. Many of the well-known famous landmarks of Asheville are coated in racism. The famous Battery Park Hotel, which once ranked “with any first-class hotel in the country'' was “the place selected, during the war, by the Confederates as the defense to the city” (Chapin 115). Similarly, Health Resorts of the South and Summer Resorts of New England dotes upon the town of Alexander, which “is ten miles north of Asheville” and described as a place “where guests receive a true old-time Southern welcome,” their “host being the Hon. Robert B. Vance, the most courteous of gentlemen, was a brigadier-general in the Confederate service, and for twelve years member of Congress from the 8th and 9th districts of North Carolina” (Chapin 125). Vance memorials continue to exist in Asheville today, acting as a gate to keep people out. Scholar Hannah Swamidoss points out how Burnett perpetuates this relation of natural relaxation with race by presenting “a range of skin color in the book: black, yellow, and a rosy pink or white. Mary starts as a sickly yellow and progresses toward a healthy pink. The racial overtones are undeniable” (Swamidoss 176). By participating actively in the British garden, Mary can become “pink and English,” and thus, happy and healthy (Swamidoss 177). This luxury, however, would not be available to her if she weren’t white. 

![Hot Springs](https://www.romanticasheville.com/sites/default/files/images/basic_page/GPI-2.jpg)
In addition to race, Mary’s class allows her to uproot and move. Similarly, flocks of wealthy northerners can move to Edenic lands in the South whenever they are sick, or city life gets too “stuffy.” Chapin states that “Probably no Southern city has so large a proportion of Northern people among its population” (Chapin 76). Being known as a haven for healing, tons of wealthy people hurried into the city, which continues to occur in Asheville. For example, F. Scott Fitzgerald did not only move Zelda to Asheville but lived there himself off and on when his tuberculosis started to get worse. He described the city air of Baltimore as making him cough, so he would often travel to Asheville for a breath of fresh air. In a 1935 letter to Harold Ober, Fitzgerald wrote that he arrived in Asheville from Baltimore “weak as hell,” that he had “got the grippe and spat blood again” and is “grateful I came south when I did though- I made a wretched mistake in coming north in Sept.” In the letter, he also complains about the expense of living in Asheville, saying that “I use up my health making money and then my money in recovering health” (Fitzgerald 216). One can imagine that if F. Scott Fitzgerald, someone who had a relatively consistent high income, complained of the cost of living in Asheville, residing in comfort here would be pretty impossible for most people.

Like F. Scott Fitzgerald, George Vanderbilt, and many other wealthy, white northerners moved down to Asheville for its beautiful scenery and rehabilitating mountain air. Vanderbilt built his home, Biltmore, here, which cost him “six million of dollars upon the estate,” an exuberant amount of money that would transfer to $34,639,036 today (Chapin 123). Because of its reputation, at first, “Asheville was known as a summer resort only to a few wealthy southerners from the low country.” As its reputation grew, wealthy people also moved from the north and other areas (Chapin 83). Expensive hotels were built, large houses, fancy hospitals, and high tuition boarding schools were soon a significant part of the small city and have been ever since. People like Fitzgerald often stayed at the Grove Park Inn (Fitzgerald 220). A one-night stay at the Grove Park Inn costs around $450 (Omni). At Biltmore, where George Vanderbilt spent his fortune, guests can stay at The Inn on Biltmore Estate for around $500 a night (Stay). In addition to fancy hotels, Asheville has been home to expensive, boarding schools for years. George Chapin states in his 1897 novel that “No Southern town can surpass Asheville in educational advantages” (Chapin 105). He then goes into great detail describing “the boarding department and all the departments of literature, art, music, etc. are in one large building with spacious halls, broad verandas, bathrooms, and every modern convenience necessary to the comfort, health and intellectual and physical development of the pupils” at The Asheville Female College (Chapin 115). Not much has changed, as Asheville’s most esteemed boarding school, Asheville School, costs a yearly fee of $66,250 (Tuition). Chapin goes on to describe many of the fancy homes built in the city, stating, “Many wealthy men have been attracted by the incomparable climate of this region, and the result is that numerous palatial residences have been erected, rich in treasures of wealth and taste” (Chapin 115). In addition to rich people moving into the area, wealthy tourists make extravagant vacations in the city, and the population thus grows exponentially along with the cost of living.

One cannot even see the hot springs without paying a large sum of money. Hot Springs Resort and Spa now utilizes the natural healing properties of the springs as advertised. Its website says, “Come to where Mother Nature waved her magical wand and created one of the most natural wonders, Natural Hot Mineral Waters. Heated deep within the earth, these crystal clear carbonated waters are world-famous for their mineral content and legendary healing powers.” A one-night stay at their hotel or cabins costs around $150-$200. If you want to save money but still see the hot springs, you can rent a tent site for $90 (Hot). Regardless, something that has once been free is now only accessible to those who can afford it. In addition to rising tourism costs, it is becoming increasingly more expensive to live and exist in the city. Citizen-Times has recently reported that rental rates have jumped 25% in the past year, and Asheville is now the most expensive city in North Carolina (Boyle).

Despite the cost of living being so high, a large number of Asheville's population is living in poverty next to their wealthy neighbors. One hundred twenty-five thousand people live in poverty in Asheville and the surrounding area; thus, many locals view the scenic land as one of labor rather than relaxation (Boyle). This distinction is seen in The Secret Garden as well. Swamidoss writes, “Burnett also portrays a class structure within the British community” (Swamidoss 173). While Dickon does get access into Mary and Colin’s secret garden, it is clear that his purpose there is to entertain. Furthermore, when Ben Weatherstaff is asked what he would plant in his garden, Ben says he would produce food rather than aesthetics, yet because he is always tending to Craven gardens, he does not have a chance (Burnett 106). However, Burnett depicts the servants as happy at their work and also gaining enjoyment from it. In reality, this is not the case. During my time living in Asheville, most of my friends there had to serve wealthy guests and tourists at the Biltmore or fancy hotels and restaurants in the area where we never stayed. Since this is a reality for many locals, they do not have the time or money to sit back and relax in the land’s natural properties. These lands are of labor, not of healing for the lower class.

Edward O. Wolcott wrote in an advertisement for Asheville, “there was never a lovelier spot than the Hot Springs since the days of Eden” (Chapin 141). But whose Eden is this? While narratives of healing and happiness are expressed in The Secret Garden and advertisements and widespread beliefs of Asheville, only a select few have access to these properties. Until we recognize the inequality surrounding holistic healing and relaxation and learn to give nature back and make it accessible for everyone, natural resorts, holistic practices, and regular leisure in nature will remain a privilege.
